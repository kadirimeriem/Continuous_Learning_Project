# Continuous Learning Project: Advanced Neural Network Architectures

## Description
This project demonstrates continuous learning (also known as lifelong learning) using advanced neural network architectures. The primary focus is on training models that can learn and adapt to new tasks without forgetting previously learned tasks. The implementation includes various techniques to prevent catastrophic forgetting and optimize the model's performance across multiple learning phases.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the concept of **continuous learning** in the context of deep learning. Continuous learning is crucial for building AI systems that can learn and adapt over time without forgetting what they have already learned. In this project, various neural network architectures, including feedforward networks and convolutional networks, are implemented and tested with techniques like **elastic weight consolidation** (EWC) and **progressive neural networks** to ensure stability and flexibility during learning.
