# Continuous Learning Project: Advanced Neural Network Architectures

## Description
This project demonstrates continuous learning (also known as lifelong learning) using advanced neural network architectures. The primary focus is on training models that can learn and adapt to new tasks without forgetting previously learned tasks. The implementation includes various techniques to prevent catastrophic forgetting and optimize the model's performance across multiple learning phases.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the concept of **continuous learning** in the context of deep learning. Continuous learning is crucial for building AI systems that can learn and adapt over time without forgetting what they have already learned. In this project, various neural network architectures, including feedforward networks and convolutional networks, are implemented and tested with techniques like **elastic weight consolidation** (EWC) and **progressive neural networks** to ensure stability and flexibility during learning.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Continuous_Learning_Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
cd Continuous_Learning_Project
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For Mac/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install the dependencies:
```bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Code Structure
The project contains three main Jupyter Notebooks:

1_Preprocessing_and_Initial_Model.ipynb: This notebook handles data preprocessing and the setup of the initial neural network model.
2_Training_and_Learning.ipynb: This notebook trains the neural network model and applies continuous learning techniques to adapt to new tasks.
3_Evaluation_and_Results.ipynb: This notebook evaluates the performance of the model, compares it with baseline models, and visualizes the results.

## Usage
To execute the notebooks, open them in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
Then, navigate to the notebook directory and run each notebook sequentially to see the results of preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
tensorflow
matplotlib
scikit-learn
jupyter
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
The evaluation section of the third notebook shows how the model performs when learning continuously. We compare the performance of the model with techniques like EWC and Progressive Neural Networks.
